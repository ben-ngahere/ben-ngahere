*Tech: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Auth0, PostgreSQL, Docker*

**Fit Quest** - *Live Project*  
Collaborative fitness RPG that gamifies real-world activity. Served as Agile Facilitator during development.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

## 🏔️ When I'm Not Coding
Mountain biking the trails, snowboarding, casual RPG gaming and tinkering with tech setups at home.

Always keen for a chat about tech!
